   Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms. In simple words, polymorphism

print("\n Constructor Chaining supper()")
"""Constructor Chaining
   Constructors are used for instantiating an object. The task of the constructor is to assign value to data
    members when an object of the class is created.
  Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor. Constructor 
  chaining is useful when you want to invoke multiple constructors, one after another, by initializing only
  one instance.

  In Python, constructor chaining is convenient when we are dealing with inheritance. When an instance of
  a child class is initialized, the constructors of all the parent classes are first invoked and then, 
  in the end, the constructor of the child class is invoked.
  Using the super() method we can invoke the parent class constructor from a child class."""
